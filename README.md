# Shear-force-and-bending-moment-calculator
This code can be used to plot the shear force and bending moment diagrams of simply supported beams under selective load types as illustrated in the READ_ME.pdf file.
To use the code, running main.py is enough. VMFunctions.py contains all the functions which are called by main.py.
